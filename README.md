curalink - social bookmarking for communities
=============================================

The intent for creating Curalink was to make sharing links to interesting resources as easy as possible.

Curalink doesn't try to replace or be so big and flexible as digg/reddit. 

Curalink's planned features: 
1. Adding links
2. Searching for links
3. Notifications (per user) 
4. Creating popularity ranking 

As of the time of updating this README (18th of February 2016) Curalink is in very early stage of development and most of the functionalities are still on our to-do list.
